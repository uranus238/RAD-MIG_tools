# RAD-MIG_tools

#### This is a collection of scripts for processing and analying genomic data.
#### I mainly focus on dealing with Reduced Representation Sequence (RRS) data obtained by RAD-seq, MIG-seq and GRAS-Di is assumed (but any other data could be applied).

## Calculate sequence dissimilarity

**calc_pairwise_sim.R** is the script which reads phylip format generated by Stacks to calculate number of substitutions. You can visualize heat maps as well.

## Calculate and plot 1d SFS from VCF files

#### Calculate SFS

```
# code block
Rscript xx.R xx.vcf
```

#### Plot SFS

```
Rscript xx.R xx.vcf
```


#### Plot SFS with geometric distribution
